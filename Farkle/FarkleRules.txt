1. Objective
	Score 10,000 points

2. Points
	1 = 100 points
	5 = 50 points
	Three 1's = 1000 points
	Three of a kind, not 1's = 100 x (face value)
	Points are accumulated in the turn's points during the turn.
	If the turn is successful, the points are added to the player's total.
	If the player rolls a Farkle, the turn's points are lost.

3. Entering the game
	The first player rolls all 6 dice.
	They may set aside any dice worth points.
	They must set aside at least 1 die per roll.
	They must continue to roll the non-point dice until they reach 1,000 points.
	Upon reaching 1,000 points, that player has officially entered the game.
		They may stop rolling dice at any time to pass their turn to the next player.
		The only exception to stopping a dice roll is when all 6 dice are points.
	If there are no point dice in a roll, that is a Farkle.
		The player loses their turn.
		All of the points earned this turn are lost.
	If all dice are point dice, the player must roll all 6 dice again.

4. Normal turn
	Roll all 6 dice.
	The player may set aside any dice worth points.
	At least 1 die must be set aside per roll.
	The player may stop rolling at any time, with one exception.
		This ends the player's turn.
		Add the turn's score to the player's total score.
	The exception is when all 6 dice are set aside for points.

	If none of the rolled dice are worth points, that is a Farkle.
		The player loses the turn's points.
		The player passes their turn to the next player.

5. Winning the game
	The end of the game is initiated if any player accumulates 10,000 points.
